'@backstage/create-app': patch
---

Postgres-based search is now installed when PG is chosen as the desired database for Backstage.

There is no need to make this change in an existing Backstage backend. See [supported search engines](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/search-engines) for details about production-ready search engines.
