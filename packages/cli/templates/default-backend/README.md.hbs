Welcome to the {{id}} package!

_This package was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

This additional backend package lets you run a selection of Backstage backend plugins separately from your other backend(s).
You likely want to create a separate configuration file for it in your project root, as well as configure routing in both the backend and frontend to make sure that all backend plugins are reachable.
